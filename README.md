# python-game-of-life
Conway's Game of Life, made with Python

This is my version of the Game of Life I managed to create as one of my challenges.
There's not too much else I can think of to add to it except try to clean up the code
	as best as I can and make it run as efficient as it can.
	
One of my next goals is to write this for Linux, using Bash, which should be tricky enough.
